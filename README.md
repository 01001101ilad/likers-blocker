Inspired by [Mario Sixtus (@sixtus)](https://twitter.com/sixtus):

> In Ãœbrigen wÃ¼nsche ich mir fÃ¼r solche FÃ¤lle ein Twitter-Add-On, das alle Liker eines bestimmten Tweets blockt, weil es nur ArschlÃ¶cher sein kÃ¶nnen. Wer programmiert es?

In collaboration with [@pkreissel](https://twitter.com/pkreissel), who wrote the back-end for this tool: https://github.com/pkreissel/ichbinhier_twittertools.

## Installation

---

**NOTE:**
The Extension is currently in beta status. This means that it can not be considered as stable and there may be bugs. See [Issues](https://github.com/dmstern/likers-blocker/issues).

Since the extension is not yet available in the *Chrome Web Store* or on *Firefox Add-Ons*, you will have to install it manually. Please note that you won't get updates if you install the extension manually.

If you have problems with the installation, it's reccomended to wait until the extension is officially published (turn on notifications for [#19](https://github.com/dmstern/likers-blocker/issues/19)).

You can also test the extension locally, see [Development](#development) (this is only reccomended for advanced users).

* You can also chose to block all retweeters of the tweet (only direct retweeters without comment).
* If you use it for the first time, you will have to authorize the app to access your twitter account.
* You get a list of all users that are about to be blocked.
* Confirm and wait for the sucess message.
* âœ” DONE. All the collected likers of the tweet are blocked. ðŸ˜‡

## Constraints

* For big lists of likers (hundrets and more), not *all* likers are blocked, we can only collect those who are visible in the list from twitter.
