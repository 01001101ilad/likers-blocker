# Likers Blocker

A Chrome extension to block all likers of a tweet.

Inspired by [Mario Sixtus (@sixtus)](https://twitter.com/sixtus):

> In Ãœbrigen wÃ¼nsche ich mir fÃ¼r solche FÃ¤lle ein Twitter-Add-On, das alle Liker eines bestimmten Tweets blockt, weil es nur ArschlÃ¶cher sein kÃ¶nnen. Wer programmiert es?
